# RADS
RADS - Remotely Activated Detonation System


Code is very messed up and hacky but run 'rad.py' to active gui and detonate. 
Run 'turnoff.py' to active gui to cut circit.

NOTE: Must me run headless! (without a monitor). I used VNC. This is becasue the monitor pulls too much power and the RPI needs all of the power it can get when turning the relay on and off via GPIO.

Used with a 5v relay and a raspberry pi.
